This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with ALX Africa Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with Holberton School - now aquired by the AFRICA LEADERSHIP GROUP(ALG, ALX, ALU) by Jimoh Lukman Olamilekan
All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.
