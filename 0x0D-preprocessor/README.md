The preprocessor will process directives that are inserted into the C source code. These directives allow additional actions to be taken on the C source code before it is compiled into object code.

Preprocessing directives are lines in your program that start with #. The # is followed by an identifier that is the directive name. For example, #define is the directive that defines a macro. Whitespace is also allowed before and after the #. The # and the directive name cannot come from a macro expansion.
